{"name":"Lambdasequence","tagline":"","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\nLambdaSequence is a tool meant to draw the method calls sequence within your applications. It provides a java agent that\r\nyou must configure within your application launch VM parameters. The java agent option is only \r\navailable since JVM >= 1.5\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunch the agent\r\n----------------\r\nThe agent tries enhancing all classes to log all method calls and return. \r\n\r\nIt does NOT work with any of the class loaded by the SystemClassLoader, hence all JVM classes such as \"String\" are not checked.\r\n\r\nTo run an agent which will open a dialog monitor by itself, add the following JVM parameters to your application:\r\n```\r\n-javaagent:/path/to/the/agent/lambdaSequence.jar=[options]\r\n```\r\nSo, the available agent options are:\r\n* `+<package_name>` : the specified package will be traced\r\n* `-<package_name>` : the specified package will be not traced\r\n* `file=/a/path/to/the_dump_file.lbds` : the log will be saved in this specified file\r\nIf no file is specified, the default output will in your home directory nammed ```call_trace-<timestamp>.lbds```\r\n\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n  `-javaagent:/tmp/lambdaSequence.jar=+my.package,file=/tmp/dump.lbds`\r\n  Will imply the trace of only one package which nammed \"my.package\" and the log will be saved in `/tmp/dump.lbds`\r\n\r\nLaunch the display engine\r\n-------------------------\r\nIn order to launch this software to display your diagram, use this command line:\r\n```\r\n  java -jar lambdaSequence.jar /your/dump_file.lbds\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecial commmands:\r\nIf you want to save your diagram image into a file, juste press the `[s]` key on your keyboard and specify the file name.\r\nExample: \r\n```\r\n  /tmp/diagram.bmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nColor code:\r\n* Constructor calls are displayed in red\r\n* Method calls are displayed in blue\r\n* Return call are displayed in grey\r\n* Each thread is represented by a colored raw which contains the id of the thread (\"Th id 12\")\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n-----\r\nThe source code of this software is not well documented yet. This is an alpha version distributed into order to get returns about bugs, desired features, ...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
